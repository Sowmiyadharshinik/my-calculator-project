# my-calculator-project
My first project on github
This is a simple calculator project that I developed as part of my learning journey in programming. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator has a user-friendly interface with buttons for numeric input and operations, displaying results in real-time.
